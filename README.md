# RosaServerCore (jpxs)

The standard implementation of RosaServer including a plugin/gamemode system.
Vastly improved upon by the JPXS Team from the original by jdbool. Featuring enums, strongly typed `.data` capability, strongly typed hooks, and more. 

Requires [RosaServer](https://github.com/jpxs-intl/RosaServer).

# Getting Started

## Configuration

Copy `config.sample.yml` to `config.yml` and modify to your heart's content.

## Scripting

The easiest way to start working is to create either a plugin or a gamemode. They work the same, except only one gamemode can be enabled at a time.

## Types

If you use VS Code, you can get IntelliSense working using [this Lua extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua).

IntelliJ IDEA also has better support, using [this plugin](https://github.com/EmmyLua/IntelliJ-EmmyLua).

All the RosaServer types/globals are laid out in `.meta/template` for this reason. It's also useful as documentation.

# Standard Plugins
